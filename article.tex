%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Artificial intelligence is here to stay. 
  In particular, Deep Learning techniques and models in the last years outperform hand-craft human solutions in different contexts, ranging from computer vision to videogames.
  Currently, though, an all-encompassing Eeep learning model does not exist, so researchers explore the possibility to apply these outstanding techniques in different fields.
  One of the most challenging is Cyber-Physical System. Here, engineers have to handle large scale, global-to-local behaviour mapping,
  highly environment stochasticity. 
  Historically, researchers favour handling them with self-organisation, by which a collective behaviour emerges from continuously local interaction between simple components.
  A novel technique to specify self-organising behaviour in a composable and functional manner is Aggregate Computing. Even though is promising for expressing high-level collective behaviour, 
  it needs to build low-level blocks that tend to be tricky. 
  On the opposite side, some research lines apply deep learning (supervised, reinforcement, non-supervised and self-supervised)
  along with CPS. Currently, though, no one gain popularity and solution tend to be application-specific.
  So, we outline a Neural Network model that could be applied in Aggregate Computing, making the possibility to combine declarative and automatic approaches that can easily scale in application complexity.
